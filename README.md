# YET ANOTHER FINANCIAL CALCULATOR
This tool is designed to calculate SIP returns just like any other SIP calculator out there but one thing that makes this different than most is that unlike other calculators you are not asked to give an expected rate of return,
The tool works on real time data, which means you just have to select the mutual funds, SIP amount and dates. 

We would simulate the actual growth of your investments based on real NAV's of your favourite direct growth mutual funds.
