# SIP Returns Calculator Project

This project provides a Java program for calculating the returns on Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) based on historical Net Asset Value (NAV) data of a mutual fund.

## Introduction

The program takes historical data in the form of open and close NAV values for each month and calculates the returns for SIP investments. It also demonstrates how to calculate the final amount after a specified tenure.


**Additional Notes**
    - The program provides basic calculations and may not account for all factors in real-world investments.
    - Consider consulting a financial advisor for comprehensive investment advice.
